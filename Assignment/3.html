	<div>stuff happened, I grew up The poet here attempts to demystify human notion of heaven.  It is that blissful state that makes the poet realise the heavenly experience in the company of Nature on earth. He shares his emotions with readers. He finds divine creation all pervasive that he can’t stop glorifying the beauties on earth. So, Kuvempu wonders in this state, if Heaven is not on earth, where else can it be! As he finds it, the experience of God is within us - just an extension of good qualities. If we fail to imbibe these virtues, there can be no Gods. The most beautiful heavenly maids are amidst us and within. If we can see such nymphs right around us, then they are nowhere else. Nature’s creations have such an eternal influence on the poet’s mind that the roaring stream, rolling waves and the verdant gardens look gilt under the tender sun. The poet captures the splendour of harvest under the moon light that spills all over the earth turning it into a heaven! Kuvempu who is the high priest of Nature is filled with this joyful experience of heaven. The poet rightly says that only one who is soaked in this experience can create heaven on earth. This poem is beautiful and delightful
